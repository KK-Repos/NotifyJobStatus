![NGJS](https://kk-artifacts.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/banner2.png)

Retrieve the workflow job status for specified jobs within a GitHub workflow run.

This GitHub Action fetches the status of one or two specified jobs within a running workflow and makes the results available for downstream actions. It is ideal for integrating job status checks into your workflows for conditional execution or Slack notifications.

## Usage

    GH_PROJECT_REPONAME: 'your-repository'
    RUN_ID: ${{ github.run_id }}
    JOB_NAME_1: 'job_name_1'
    JOB_NAME_2: 'job_name_2'  # Optional
    CHANNEL_ID: ${{ secrets.CHANNEL_ID }}
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
